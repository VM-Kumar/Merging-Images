The content is organized as follows:
1. [description_report.pdf](https://github.com/VM-Kumar/Merging-Images/blob/main/description_report.pdf): Detailed report on methodology of merging and functioning of code. Also involves details of chosing shaped regions to merge.
2. [final_merging_code.m](https://github.com/VM-Kumar/Merging-Images/blob/main/final_merging_code.m): Final code for image merging. Add the path of two images to merge as given in code comment. Select type of region. Choose the region in the new window. Finally obtain merged image. More details are given in the report.
3. [input_output_images](https://github.com/VM-Kumar/Merging-Images/tree/main/input_output_images): folder containing sample input images and merged output images
4. [myconvolve_2D.m](https://github.com/VM-Kumar/Merging-Images/blob/main/myconvolve_2D.m): matlab function used in final_merging_code.m to perform 2d convolution. Can ignore this section and use inbuilt matlab 2D conv function as specified in code comment.
